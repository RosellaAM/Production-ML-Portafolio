## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🎨 Project 1: GalleryAI - Immersive Virtual Art Experience
**Domain:** Cultural Technology & Experience Design | **Model:** Content-Based Filtering + Multi-Sensory Integration

**Business Context:** Traditional digital art collections lack emotional engagement. GalleryAI transforms art discovery into an immersive journey by combining visual art with atmospheric music and intelligent recommendations.

**Technical Solution:** Built a content-based recommendation engine using The Met's Open Access API, enhanced with multi-sensory experience design. The system analyzes artwork metadata to create personalized gallery tours paired with mood-appropriate music.

**Key Features:**
* 🎯 **AI-Powered Curation**: Intelligent artwork recommendations using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
* 🖼️ **Guaranteed Visual Experience**: Curated collection with confirmed high-quality images
* 🎵 **Immersive Audio**: Mood-matching background music for each artwork era
* 🏛️ **Virtual Gallery Layout**: Streamlit-powered exhibition space
* 🔍 **Smart Filtering**: Explore by era, department, mood, and artistic style
* 💫 **Personal Exhibitions**: Save and share custom art collections

**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Nearest Neighbors, Streamlit, Pandas, Requests, HTML5 Audio

**Live Demo:** [Coming Soon] | **Code:** [Coming Soon]

### 📱 Project 2: Megaline Plan Recommendation Engine
**Domain:** Telecommunications | **Model:** Random Forest Classifier (88% Accuracy)

**Business Context:** Telecom operators typically experience 15-25% annual churn rates. Identifying customers at risk and recommending optimal service plans is critical for retention and revenue optimization.

**Technical Solution:** Developed a classification system that analyzes customer usage patterns (call minutes, data usage, text messages) to recommend the most suitable mobile plan, reducing misaligned subscriptions and improving customer satisfaction.

**Key Features:**
* 📈 **Batch Processing**: Analyze entire customer datasets for segmentation opportunities
* 👤 **Individual Recommendations**: Real-time plan suggestions with confidence scoring
* 📊 **Usage Analytics**: Interactive visualizations of customer behavior patterns
* 📥 **Operational Integration**: Export functionality for CRM and marketing systems

**Model Performance:**
* Accuracy: 88%
* Precision: 0.87
* Recall: 0.85
* F1-Score: 0.86

**Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Joblib, Plotly

**Live Demo:** [View Application](https://megalineapppy-tsf.streamlit.app/) | **Code:** [megaline_plans/](https://github.com/RosellaAM/Production-ML-Showcase/blob/main/MegalinePlans/megaline_app.py)
